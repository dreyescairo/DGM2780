				These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new
				life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each
				unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy
				readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000
				percent.

				Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The
				organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract
				it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction
				is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.
